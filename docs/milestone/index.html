<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

<p>
	So far for the project we have accomplished rendering homogeneous media by extending our pathtracer from Project 3, while our overall plan is to render heterogenous media. 
</p>

<p>
	We hardcoded in a default absorption coefficient, which affects the radiance along a light ray as the ray moves through the media. The incoming radiance that reaches an intersection point is reduced from traveling through the medium, as well as the radiance that reaches our eye as we shoot a ray from the camera to the intersection point. We calculate the reduction in radiance with the formula $L(x, w) = e^{\sigma_a \Delta_x} L(x + \Delta_x w, w)$, which states that the difference in radiance is proportional to the distance the the ray travels through the media, as long as it is homogeneous.
</p>

<p>
	We still have a significant amount of work to reach our goal of rendering heterogeneous media. To do this, we have to define density and other parameters per grid, and further extend our pathtracer to implement raymarching instead of simple intersection tests. We also have to implement in-scattering and out-scattering to make the renders seem more realistic, and we would also like to add in emissive effects. We found some datasets with already defined density grids, but we would like to generate grids for some of the files given to us in the class projects.

<h1 align="middle">Final Project Milestone: Rendering Realistic Smoke and Clouds</h1>
<h2 align="middle">Sarah Au and Sol Ah Yoo</h2>

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

<p>
	So far for the project we have accomplished rendering homogeneous media by extending our pathtracer from Project 3, while our overall plan is to render heterogenous media.
</p>

<p>
	We hardcoded in a default absorption coefficient, which affects the radiance along a light ray as the ray moves through the media. The incoming radiance that reaches an intersection point is reduced from traveling through the medium, as well as the radiance that reaches our eye as we shoot a ray from the camera to the intersection point. We calculate the reduction in radiance with the formula $L(x, w) = e^{\sigma_a \Delta_x} L(x + \Delta_x w, w)$, which states that the difference in radiance is proportional to the distance the the ray travels through the media, as long as it is homogeneous.
</p>

<p>
	We still have a significant amount of work to reach our goal of rendering heterogeneous media. To do this, we have to define density and other parameters per grid, and further extend our pathtracer to implement raymarching instead of simple intersection tests. We also have to implement in-scattering and out-scattering to make the renders seem more realistic, and we would also like to add in emissive effects. We found some datasets with already defined density grids, but we would like to generate grids for some of the files given to us in the class projects.

</div>

<p> As shown above, smaller absorption coefficients create lighter smoke while larger coefficients create darker and more dense smoke because as more particles absorb light, the thicker the smoke gets. With $\sigma_a = 0.5$, the sphere is barely visible, while with $\sigma_a = 12.5$,  the sphere looks almost solid (without the shading). The shadows on the ground also changes with the coefficient. The participating media absorbs light between the light source to the ground plane and casts a shadow. Hence, the thicker the smoke, the darker the shadow. </p>
<p>Because we hardcoded the coefficient value, the sphere smoke is uniform in density. But for later parts of the project, we plan to have a grid with different densities, as stated above, to render more realistic looking smoke. </p>
